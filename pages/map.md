## Live Vehicles

Live vehicle view provides a real-time view of every vehicle included in your fleet. The live vehicle action panel provides several tools to quickly locate an active vehicle within the map. For snow plows and other vehicles with sensors (sweepers, etc.) the current sensor status is displayed for all live vehicles.

* Selecting a vehicle from the action panel will pan the map and highlight the vehicle.
* The action panel updates in real-time and displays the last message received for the vehicle.
* Vehicles with messages received during the last three (3) hours are highlighted in light blue within the action panel.
* Selecting a vehicle from the map will show a pop-up menu with the last message received for the vehicle.
* Filtering the list of live vehicles by category will filter the map.
    * i.e. Click Plow to only see plows in the map.
    * i.e. Click Sweeper to only see sweepers in the map.

**Other notes:**

* Vehicle message interval is controlled by Networkfleet configuration. For plows a 15 second reporting interval is strongly recommended. Please contact Networkfleet support to adjust the reporting interval. Also please note faster reporting intervals will increase data fees with Networkfleet.
* Live vehicle breadcrumbs are styled in the map based on their category and whether they are moving or idle.
* Live vehicles that are treating (i.e. plow down, spreader on, brush on) will be highlighted with a yellow circle.

## Historical Vehicles

The historical vehicle view provides tools to search for vehicle breadcrumbs captured over time. There are three basic search filters that can be applied to historical vehicles (**Date**, **Vehicles**, **Location**). You are required to provide a date filter for all historic searches. The results of your search will be shown in a table and within the map. The table and map are interactive, clicking on a record in the table will pan the map and clicking on a breadcrumb from the map will highlight the record in the table. The results table also allows you to sort results on any of the columns (Vehicle, Role, Time, Heading, Speed, Sensor 1, Sensor 2).

**Notes:**
* You can combine filters to find specific breadcrumbs of interest.
* Breadcrumb searches are limited to 10,000 records. If you select a large amount of breadcrumbs you will receive the first 10,000 breadcrumbs that meet your criteria.
